# URI Program Finder

Add [programs-categories] to a page and a form magically appears.

## What's new in 1.3.0

Program Finder 1.3.0 is a minor update.

- Adds a curriculum sheets field and updates template accordingly
- The return key no longer submits the form, which would result in an unstyled results screen
- Fixes a bug that caused multiple redraws of each card when loading
- Fixes a bug that caused urls containing multi-word search terms to populate the search field with dashes in place of spaces, thereby returning no results
- Fixes a bug that caused the url terms parameter to reset on page load even if terms exist
